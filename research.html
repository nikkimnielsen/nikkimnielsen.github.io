            <h3>Illuminating the Vast Cosmic Ecosystems of Galaxies</h3>

	    <p>The OU CGM group studies the <b>baryon cycle</b>, or
	    the flow of gas into and out of galaxies. Cosmological
	    simulations show this cycling of gas is vital for
	    regulating <b>galaxy evolution</b> and building up the
	    mass in galaxies. We examine the properties and motions of
	    the <b>circumgalactic medium (CGM)</b>, a massive and
	    diffuse reservoir of gas surrounding galaxies out to 100
	    times the size of their stellar disks.</p>

	    <p>By comparing the CGM to host galaxy properties (star
	    formation activity, redshift, orientation, environment,
	    etc.), we determine whether the extended gas
	    is <b>accreting</b> from the intergalactic medium (IGM) or
	    CGM (via recycled accretion), <b>outflowing</b> from star
	    formation in the galaxy, or being <b>tidally stripped</b>
	    from merging satellite galaxies and galaxy&ndash;galaxy
	    interactions. This constrains the role that the baryon
	    cycle plays in galaxy evolution and tests predictions from
	      simulations.</p>

	    <h4>Our research aims to:</h4>

	    <ul class="ord">
	      <li>Determine the spatial, geometric, and kinematic
		distribution of the CGM.</li>
	      <li>Use gas kinematics, metallicities, and geometry to
		quantify gas flow rates.</li>
	      <li>Determine how changes in galaxy star formation rate
		change gas flow rates and the CGM.</li>
	      <li>Connect the interstellar medium (ISM) to the CGM for
	      a comprehensive view of how galaxies obtain and process
	      their gas.</li>

	      <h3>The CGM at Cosmic Noon with KCWI</h3>
	      <p>We are building a new sample at <b>Cosmic Noon</b>
	      (z=2&ndash;3) to study gas flows when galaxies are most
	      actively building their mass. The galaxies are
	      identified with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, <b>KCWI</b>
	      (an integral field spectrograph), and we use
	      spectrographs such as HIRES/Keck and UVES/VLT to analyze
	      their CGM properties in as much detail as at lower
	      redshifts.</p>

	      <p>We have published 2 papers with this program so
	      far. In
	      the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08516">first
	      paper</a> we modeled outflows along the minor axis of an
	      isolated galaxy. AAS Nova highlighted this work
	      in <a href="https://aasnova.org/2021/05/14/seeing-star-formation-at-cosmic-noon/">''Seeing
	      Star Formation at Cosmic Noon.''</a></p>

	      <p>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12501">second
	      paper</a> explored a highly complex absorption system
	      associated with a compact group of galaxies. The
	      galaxies give rise to metal-rich high velocity outflows
	      and tidal streams. We also found evidence for a
	      significant amount of metal-poor accretion onto the
	      galaxies from the IGM.</p>

	      <h3>Multiphase Galaxy Halos Survey</h3>
	      <p>With <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/cwc/Group/PID13398/">this
	      survey</a>, we study low redshift (z &#60; 1)
	      absorber&ndash;galaxy pairs in OVI (tracing the warm-hot
	      CGM) and other multiphase absorption. These data were
	      obtained through a Large program on the <i><b>Hubble
	      Space Telescope</b></i> with the Cosmic Origins
		Spectrograph, COS.</p>

	      <p>We
	      examined <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05557">how
	      CGM metallicity varies with location</a> around
	      galaxies.  We expected to find pristine (low
	      metallicity) gas accreting along galaxy disks and
	      enriched (high metallicity) gas outflowing perpendicular
	      to galaxies. Our work showed that our simple picture of
	      CGM gas flows is much more complicated, where
	      also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04310">accounting
	      for the galaxy's ISM metallicity</a> does not yet help
		disentangle inflows from outflows alone.</p>

	    <div class="content">      
	      <p>Most recently we explored whether and how the
	      multiphase absorption aligns with the rotation of galaxy
	      disks. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05164">Neutral
	      hydrogen persistently co-rotates</a> with galaxy disks
	      to large distances within the CGM. As
	      the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05165">ionization
	      of the gas increases</a>, gas co-rotates less strongly
	      with the galaxy. Lower ionization, lower temperature,
	      and more dense gas is more clearly an important tracer
	      of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium, adding
	      angular momentum and fresh star-forming material to
	      galaxy disks.</p>

	      only recently become possible with new instruments like
	      the <b>Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI)</b>
	      and <b>MUSE</b>. These images can spatially resolve the
	      gas out to several tens of kiloparsecs from nearby
	      galaxies and obtain information about the distribution

	      <h3>Gas flows in and very near to face-on and edge-on
	      galaxies in DUVET</h3>
		      
	      <p>So far we
	      have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04672">measured
	      outflows</a> across the entire disk of the nearly
	      face-on pilot DUVET galaxy, IRAS08. From the larger
	      DUVET face-on sample, we find that
	      the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17830">outflows
	      are common and are driven by energetic supernovae</a>
	      from the starbursts in each galaxy.</p>

	      <p>We
	      also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13211">traced
	      the full baryon cycle</a> in a single very edge-on
	      galaxy, Mrk 1486, using direct metallicity measurements,
	      with metal-poor accretion along the major axis and
	      metal-rich outflows along the minor axis. This was
	      highlighted in the press
	      release <a href="https://astro3d.org.au/galaxies-pump-out-contaminated-exhausts/">"Research
	      reveals how star-making pollutes the cosmos."</a>  Most

	      outflow</a> being driven from this galaxy out to nearly

	      <p>These methods for tracing the gas flows around both

	      being applied to the rest of the DUVET sample

	      <h3>Beyond DUVET: Mapping extended gaseous environments</h3>

	      <p>At OU, we are leading the more extended CGM ''bonus
	      science'' for DUVET, where we
	      have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02365-x">directly
	      imaged the gas</a> around IRAS08 out to 30 kpc (10 times
	      the size of the stellar disk!) with sub-kiloparsec
	      spatial resolution. We found <b>emission everywhere</b>
	      we observed in both oxygen (traced by [OII] and [OIII])
	      and hydrogen (traced by H&beta;), which probe low
	      ionization gas that is likely infalling onto the galaxy
		or outflowing from star formation.</p>

	      <p>Most excitingly, we revealed the
	      <b>transition between the gas in the galaxy disk and the
	      gas in the CGM</b> in both the surface brightness and
	      ionization conditions. This has important implications
	      for how galaxies interact with their gaseous
	      surroundings. Future observations and analyses will
	      determine if this transition is a common feature of
	      galaxies or a special case for our first DUVET
	      galaxy!</p>
