Table Notes:

 (a) Uncertainties are based upon uncertainties in the virial masses
     (column 6). For some quantities a larger (smaller) virial mass
     results in a smaller (larger) value such that the uncertainties
     anti-correlate. [Applies to columns 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12]

 (b) Because the slope of Rc changes sign as a function of virial
     mass, where the slope is positive the uncertainties correlate and
     where the slope is negative they anti-correlate (see Figure
     11). In the narrow virial mass ranges where the slope of Rc
     changes sign, it is possible that both the upward and downward
     uncertainties in virial mass can result in an upward (or
     downward) uncertainty in Rc.

Note on column (6): The units for the virial mass are M_sun in log
space. There are no h^-1 factors in the value.
