	    by Asst. Prof. Nikki Nielsen. We currently consist
	    of <a href="#grads">3 graduate

	    <p>We collaborate closely with astronomers around the
	    world, including at Swinburne University of Technology in
	    Australia, and US universities New Mexico State University
	    and Pennsylvania State University.</p>

	    <p>The team regularly uses some of the largest telescopes
	    in the world, including the twin Keck Observatory
	    telescopes in Hawaii, the Very Large Telescope in Chile,
	    and the <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i>.</p>

	    postdoctoral resesarch associate in the Centre for
	    Astrophysics and Supercomputing at Swinburne University of
	    Technology in Melbourne, Australia. She then became the
	    Swinburne ASTRO 3D Fellow in 2021, which was an

	      <h3>Imran Hossain</h3>
	      <p>Imran is a 4th-year PhD student. His research focuses
	      on the circumgalactic medium and quasar absorption
	      lines, exploring how galaxies acquire and lose gas over
	      cosmic time. He is specifically studying the kinematics
	      of the cool CGM to understand how gas flow properties
		change with star formation rate.</p>
	      
	      <p>Outside of research, Imran enjoys playing cricket,
	      watching movies with his family, listening to classic
	      rock, and reading short stories by Alice Munro and
		Haruki Murakami.</p>

	      <p>Kaitlyn is a 2nd year astrophysics PhD student. She
	      is currently working with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy to
	      identify the host galaxies of cool CGM absorption at
	      z=1-2.</p>

	      <p>Kaitlyn enjoys knitting, cooking, reading and

	      <h3>Amisha Rane</h3>
	      <p>Amisha just wrapped up her first year as a PhD
	      student! She's broadly interested in how gas flows
	      through the universe. During her Master's program,
	      Amisha worked on analyzing and modeling methanol
	      spectral lines toward ionized jet candidates in
	      high-mass star-forming regions. Now she's expanding that
	      passion to larger scales, studying the CGM to understand
	      how galaxies acquire, recycle, and lose their gas.</p>

	      <p>Amisha genuinely loves working with telescopes
	      &ndash; that hands-on experience is a big part of why
	      she jumped at the chance to host star parties this past
	      year. Outside of research, Amisha makes it a point to
	      swim every day or at least try to! She absolutely loves
	      vibing to music and dancing &ndash; it's her go-to way
	      to unwind and reset!</p>
